Swap.js
=======

### A native JS plugin that swaps the things

Usage:

1. Include swap.js in your project (preferably in the footer below your content)
```html
<script src="path/to/swap.js"></script>
```

2. Include your navigation items â€“ those that will be used to swap out content. Make sure you use anchor links that point to your swappable elements, and give them a class of `.swap-trigger`.
```html
<a href="#swap-item-1" class="swap-trigger">Show Item 1</a>
<a href="#swap-item-2" class="swap-trigger">Show Item 2</a>
<a href="#swap-item-3" class="swap-trigger">Show Item 3</a>
```

3. Include your swappable elements, making sure to give them IDs that match your navigation respective items, as well as a class of `.swappable`.
```html
<section id="swap-item-1" class="swappable">Content in `#swap-item-1`</section>
<section id="swap-item-2" class="swappable">Content in `#swap-item-2`</section>
<section id="swap-item-3" class="swappable">Content in `#swap-item-3`</section>
```

4. Style to your heart's content. Included is some barebones CSS to get you started. This bit of the plugin is left pretty ambiguous, considering each project will be different.

#### Note: This plugin uses **zero** dependencies, so include away. Also, you'll notice that in modern browsers the hash is changed. That means you can point to a particular section on page load. Enjoy!
